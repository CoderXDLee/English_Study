### From a Religious College to a Secular University

`Harvard College was founded in 1636 as a Puritan institution and a training ground for ministers.`

`In the first 200 years, however, it gradually shook off religious control and became a secular university.`

`During its early years, the College offered a classic academic course based on the English university model, but consistent with the prevailing Puritan philosophy of the first colonists in New England.`

`Many of its earliest graduates went on to become clergymen in Puritan churches throughout New England.  
早期许多学生毕业后都继续在新英格兰各地的清教堂里当牧师。`

`The Puritan minister in town provided direct oversight of Harvard.  
剑桥（又称坎布里奇）镇上的清教牧师直接监督哈佛大学。`

`Harvard's early motto was Christo et Ecclesiae "For Christ and the Church" instead of Veritas "Truth".  
哈佛大学早期的校训是 “为基督，为教会” 而不是 “真理”。`

`The purpose of all education was to "let every student be plainly instructed, and earnestly pressed to consider well, the main end of his life and studies is, to know God and Jesus Christ is eternal life, and therefore to lay Christ in the bottom, as the only foundation of all sound knowledge and learning."`

`Obviously, this motto was preached during a period when Puritanism was in domination and when the United States had not yet founded.  
非常明显，这个校训是在美国建国前的宗教专制时期鼓吹的。`

`From 1607 when the first English colony Jamestown was founded to 1776 when American Revolution broke out, almost all the English colonies in North America had established religious.  
从1607年第一个英属殖民地詹姆斯敦建立开始，直至1776年的美国独立战争，北美洲各英属殖民地都有法定宗教。`

`These colonies discriminated and persecuted believers in deism adn atheism, and restricted the development of science.  
这些殖民地歧视和迫害自然神论和无神论的信仰者，并且限制科学的发展。`

`Even so, Harvard College was brave enough to struggle against Puritanism.  
即便如此，哈佛学院仍勇敢地同清教主义做斗争。`

`The 1708 election of the first president John Leverett marked a turning of the College toward intellectual independence from Puritanism.  
1708年第一任校长 约翰李维立特 的当选标志着哈佛学院开始独立于清教。`

`Although he was a clergyman, Leverett set the principle of independence of Harvard academy of religion`

`After the foundation of the United States, Christan tyranny was eliminated and the cause of education which pursued truth and science began to develop.`

`Then in 1805 the takeover of Harvard by the Unitarians resulted in the secularization of Harvard.`

`In 1843, Veritas "Truth" was adopted as the motto.`

`Harvard University is secular university now.`

`However, there has, in recent years, been voices criticizing its secularity.`

`Some people argue that the study of religion at Harvard is uniquely dysfunctional while the study is very important to analyze today's world.`

`They argue for more attention to the study of religion.`

`It seems that the war between "reason" and "faith" will go on`
