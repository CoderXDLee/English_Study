## 二、Explain

`M: Hello English learners! Welcome to EnglishPod! My name is Marco.  
E: And I'm Erica.  
M: And today we're gonna be bringing you a very useful lesson about being sick.  
E: Yeah, um, we're going to learn, um, how to tell your boss that you can't go to work, because you're sick.  
M: Exactly! This is really important, because we all get sick and sometimes you just can't to to work.  
E: Yes! Or maybe sometimes you just don't want to go to work.  
M: You just...exactly, maybe you're lying.  
E: Yeah.  
M: But we're gonna be teaching you how to do it anyway, so, before we start with our dialogue, let's take a look at "vocabulary preview"`

`Voice: Vocabulary preview  
E: In this vocabulary preview we have two words for you. Uh, the first one is quite ill.  
M: Quite ill.  
E: Quite ill.  
M: So, quite ill...  
E: Very sick.  
M: Very sick.  
E: Uhu.  
M: Quite is a sysonym of very.  
E: Exactly!  
M: Okay.  
E: Yeah.  
M: And ill...  
E: Sick.  
M: Sick.  
E: Yeah.  
M: So, they both mean the same thing, no difference.  
E: No difference at all. I just think, uh, ill is more common in British English.  
M: Uh, exactly. Alright, let's take a look at our second word - flu.  
E: The flu.  
M: The flu.  
E: The flu.  
M: So, the flu is a virus.  
E: Yeah, it's a sickness.  
M: Okay, and, uh...  
E: Uhu.  
M: It's very similar to a cold.  
E: Yes, but just a lot worse.  
M: A lot worse, so, it's stronger.  
E: Yeah, yeah. Um, it's also called influenza.  
M: Influenza.  
E: Aha.  
M: Exactly. So, the flu.  
E: Uhu.  
M: Okay, so, let's listen to our dialogue. What's gonna happen here today?  
E: Well, we're going to listen as Julie calls her boss to tell him she's sick.  
M: Alright, but is she really sick?  
E: I don't know. Let's find out.  
  
DIALOGUE, FIRST TIME  
  
M: Alright, so, Julie didn't really seam to be sick, ha?  
E: Yeah, I...I don't know th... that cough was just a little to much.  
M: It seamed like she was acting.  
E: Yeah.  
M: Alright, so, let's take a look at some of this vocabulary in "language takeaway".  
  
Voice: Language takeawany  
E: We have five words for you here and these are all great words to describe a sickness, right?  
M: Uhu.  
E: Alright, the first one - headache.  
M: Headache.  
E: Headache.  
M: Headache.  
E: So, when you have a headache, you have a sore head, right?  
M: Right, your head hurts.  
E: Uhu.  
M: So, it's pretty simple.  
E: Yep.  
M: You have a headache.  
E: It's the way you feel after, um, being at a bar to late.  
M: Yeah...  
E: Yeah.  
M: When you drink to much...  
E: Yeah.  
M: You get a headche.  
E: Yeah.  
M: Alright, let's take a look at our next word - sore throat.  
E: Sore throat.  
M: Sore throat.  
E: Sore throat.  
M: So, basically, we have two words here, let's look at the first one - sore.  
E: Hurting.  
M: It hurts, right?  
E: Yeah.  
M: And your throat is...  
E: Well, it... you know it's the part right here, at the back...oh, you can't see me.[Comment: Erica points at her throat, but realizes right away that we can't see her, because it's a podcast, not a videocast]  
M: Hehe.  
E: Well, it's the part, um, at the back of your mouth that goes down to your stomach.  
M: Alright, that's your throat.  
E: Yeah.  
M: So, you use your throat to swallow.  
E: Uhu.  
M: Okay. Now, we can use the word sore with different body parts, right?  
E: Yeah, like, um, a sore back.  
M: A sore back, right? Or maybe you were playing tennis all weekend, so you have a sore arm.  
E: Aha, or even a sore neck.  
M: Right.  
E: Uhu.  
M: So, the word sore. Let's take a look at our third word - running nose.  
E: Running nose.  
M: Running nose.  
E: Running nose.  
M: This is a very strange word.  
E: I know.  
M: But is doesn't mean that your nose is running, right?  
E: No, but... okay, um, it... no, but when you have a running nose, um, there's lots of water coming out of your nose, right?  
M: Right.  
E: So, it's interesting though, because when you run, you go fast, right?  
M: Hehe. So, a lot of water is...  
E: Coming fast out of your nose.  
M: Out of your nose. Running nose.  
E: Yeah.  
M: Okay, our forth word today - slightly feverish.  
E: Slightly feverish.  
M: Slightly feverish.  
E: Slightly feverish.  
M: So, again, slightly is...  
E: A little bit.  
M: A little bit...  
E: Uhu.  
M: Right? A liitle bit. And feverish?  
E: Well, let's break this word down. Um, we know fever, right?  
M: Uhu.  
E: Um, so, when you're...when your body is very, very hot...  
M: Right.  
E: Because you're sick. So, feverish is the feeling or your body being very, very hot.  
M: Uhu. Okay, so, you have a high temperature.  
E: It's not that you have a high temperature, but you feel like you have a high temperature.  
M: Okay, so, slightly feverish.  
E: Uhu.  
M: And our last word - to recoever.  
E: Recover.  
M: Recover.  
E: Recover.  
M: So, this means to get better, right?  
E: Exactly.  
M: Can you only use it when you're sick?  
E: So, when you recover, you get better and you rest, so, maybe you can say, um, "I was so busy this week, I need to recover at this weekend".  
M: Okay, so, yeah, if you feel tired...  
E: Yeah.  
M: Or you feel sick, you can recover.  
E: Uhu.  
M: Okay, let's listen to our dialogue again and we can listen to these words that we've just talked about.  
  
DIALOGUE, SECOND TIME  
  
M: In this dialogue we listened to some really interesting phrases of how you can tell your boss that you're feeling sick, right?  
E: Yeah, some great phrases, so, let's look at these in "fluency builder".  
  
Voice: Fluency builder.  
M: Okay, let's take a look at our first phrase on fluency builder = I'm coming down with.  
E: I'm coming down with.  
M: I'm coming down with.  
E: I'm coming down with.  
M: Alright. So, let's listen to some examples and then we'll come back and explain this interesting phrase.  
  
Voice: Example one.  
A: My throat really hurts. I think I'm coming down with a cold.  
Voice: Example two.  
B: You have a running nose. Are you coming down with the flu?  
Voice: Example three.  
C: I don't feel well. I think I'm coming down with something.  
  
M: Okay, so, basically, coming down with means...  
E: Starting to get sick.  
M: Uh... um, beginning to feel sick.  
E: Yes.  
M: Okay, so, you can use it with "I'm coming down with the flu".  
E: Aha, I'm coming down with a cold.  
M: Uhu. Or I'm coming down with a cough.  
E: Yeah, or I'm coming down with something.  
M: With something, you don't what it is.  
E: Exactly.  
M: Okay, let's take a look at our second phrase - calling in sick.  
E: Calling in sick.  
M: Okay, calling in sick.  
E: So, this phrase is great! You know, when you say "I'm calling in sick..."  
M: Uhu.  
E: You're saying "hey I'm not going to come to work today, because I'm sick".  
M: Okay, so, literally, it means that you call your office...  
E: Yeah.  
M: And you say you're not going to work.  
E: Yes, um, but it's great, cause it's three words that show such a long idea.  
M: Right, because otherwise you would have to say "I'm calling, because I don't feel well, so, I'm not gonna go to work".  
E: Yes!  
M: But if you say "I'm calling in sick", everyone knows...  
E: Everyone understands.  
M: That you're not gonna go to work.  
E: Yep.  
M: Okay, now, let's take a look at our last phrase - take the day off.  
E: Take the day off.  
M: Take the day off.  
E: Take the day off.  
M: Now, this is a great phrase! To take the day off is to...  
E: Not go to work.  
M: On that day.  
E: Yes!  
M: Now, you can say "take the ... week off".  
E: Uhu, take the month off.  
M: Take the month off or...  
E: Yeah.  
M: Take the year off.  
E: Yeah, if you're so lucky.  
M: Hehe. Alright, so, take the day off means to not go to work on that day.  
E: Uhu.  
M: Alright, let's listen to our dialogue again now and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.  
  
DIALOGUE, THIRD TIME  
E: Well, Marco, um, have you ever done what Julie did? Did you ever call you boss to say you're sick to... when you're not really?  
M: Yeah, of course! I mean, sometimes you just don't feel very well, but you're not really sick, you just don't feel like going to work.  
E: Yes.  
M: Or sometimes you have something to do.  
E: Uh.  
M: Right?  
E: Yep! You know what we call those in Canada? Um, we call them personal days.  
M: Personal days.  
E: Yeah! So, you say "oh, I'm gonna take a personal day"...  
M: Ouh.  
E: Meaning I'm gonna call in sick, but then go shopping.  
M: Hehe. We used to do that a lot, because, for example, soccer games are such a big deal.  
E: Oh, yeah!  
M: And, you know, sometimes you would have, ah, a soccer match between, I don't know, Brazil... and it would be maybe at 10 a.m. or 11 a.m., so, everyone would call in sick on that day.  
E: Yeah, so, the boss at least could plan that he would have an empty office.  
M: Yeah, or sometimes you would take half the day off.  
E: Uh.  
M: So, you would just go... you say "well, I'm not gonna make it in the morning, but I'll come in the afternoon".  
E: So, you would recover...  
M: A l...  
E: Very quickly.  
M: Yeah, I'm feeling a little bit sick, but I'm going to be better in the afternoon.  
E: Yeah.  
M: Alright, so, well, if you have any questions or comments, please come to our website and if you have any calling in sick stories, please let us know.  
E: Yes, you can visit us at englishpod.com and Marco and I are always there to answer your questions.
